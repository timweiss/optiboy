Collect email addresses on your own server, complete with double opt-in.

## Motivation
The most convenient way to collect emails for a newsletter, blog, etc. is via a lot of third-party services.
Most of them reside in countries with potentially unsafe transfers. Still, a double opt-in is required to be able to send emails.

## Capabilities
* Collect email addresses via one endpoint
* Opt-in mail is sent to email
* Simple confirmation page

## Requirements
* Docker (Compose) on machine
* Any SMTP server or service
